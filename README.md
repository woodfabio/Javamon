# Javamon
 An extremely simple Pok√©mon game simulator written in Java language with OOP concepts.

The idea is to play a mini game where you choose one of 3 pok√©mons (BulbasaurüçÉ, Charmanderüî• or Squirtleüíß) and battle other pok√©mon that randomly "appear" to get experience and evolve into stronger pok√©mon.

Almost everything in this game is made based on OOP concepts. Pok√©mon species, moves used in battle and even the battles are classes with atributes and methods.

The game events happen through a loop structure. The player has 3 options: walk, heal the pok√©mon or finish the game. Each time the player walks he has a chance to start a battle with a random pok√©mon (which can be of one of the three species mentioned above), if he wins, the pok√©mon gains experience. When the pok√©mon is out of health points, the plays must choice the "heal" option to continue battling. And when the player chooses the "finish" option the game ends and shows all the pok√©mon status (attributes).
